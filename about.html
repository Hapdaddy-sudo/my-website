    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! I’m Carter Hapner, and I’m based in the great state of Indiana. I’m currently a sophomore in college, pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Criminal Justice with minors in Forensic Investigations and Psychology. Beyond my formal studies, I’m deeply invested in expanding my technical skill set through certifications such as CompTIA A+, CompTIA Network+, CompTIA Security+, Cisco CyberOps Associate, EC Council’s Certified Hacking Forensics Investigator, and AWS Cloud Foundations.</p>
    <p>At the heart of my journey is my faith in Jesus. My aspiration is to follow the Lord’s guidance so that my growing expertise in digital forensics and cybersecurity can be used wherever it’s needed most. I believe in making an impact—whether that involves seeking justice for those who can’t advocate for themselves, or using my voice and skills to stand up for what’s right in the digital world. Balancing a full-time education and a part-time job can be challenging, but my faith motivates me to keep pushing forward and to share kindness and love with everyone I meet.</p>
    <p>Throughout high school, I was honored to receive the Outstanding Student Achievement Award in the English Language Department during my sophomore year, as well as the Excellence in Speech &amp; Debate Award in my junior year. I also served as an NSDA Speech &amp; Debate Judge during my junior and senior years. These experiences not only helped me refine my communication skills, but also fueled my passion for advocating on behalf of others.</p>
    <p>When I’m not studying or working, I love diving into the world of gaming. Some of my favorite titles include Valorant, Counter-Strike 2, Overwatch, Rocket League, Outlast Trials, Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, and Kovaaks Aim Trainer. Sharing time with my significant other is a big part of my life, and I’m grateful for the support and encouragement they provide every day.</p>
    <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit more about me. I hope to continue growing, serving, and bringing justice to those who need it most—all while following the path the Lord has laid out for me. If you’d like to connect or learn more, feel free to reach out!</p>
